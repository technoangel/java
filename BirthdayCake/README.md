# Fair Cutting

This is my answer to the HackerRank question "Fair Cutting":

### From the Challenge:
"Leha is a young man from Belarus. He loves cakes really much. In Leha's country, cakes are always evenly divided between people.

Leha wants to know how many people he should invite to his party if he has a cake whose size is equal to  units and he wants each person to get exactly  units of cake. Note that Leha doesn't take a piece for himself; in other words, the cake is only divided among the people he invited to the party."

#### Input Format

The first line contains three space-separated integers describing the respective values of the slice fraction numerator, the slice fraction denominator, and the cake size (in arbitrary units).

#### Constraints

It is guaranteed that the answer is an integer.

#### Output Format

Print a single integer denoting the number of people he should invite to his party.
