Find information in a Postgres database that matches a target height and preferred sport.
This is an interview question I had to show how to look at things in a database without ORM support.

## Interview Question:

"You're looking for a person with a specific height and sport - you have to go through the data set of short vs. tall people (and the sport they play) and see if the target person exists - if they exists, what's their name?"
