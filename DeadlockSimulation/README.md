# Deadlock Simulator

This project simulates a multithread deadlock situation using String objects for locked resources

## Interview Question
"When two threads are using the same resources, they have a chance to enter a deadlocked state where both threads
are holding all the necessary resources but neither thread has all their resources they require.  Write a program
to demonstrate this situation in runtime"
